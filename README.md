**Quote from Matt Dancho,** CEO of Business Science University

"You don’t need to be perfect. 

As a data scientist, we are taught to strive for perfection. Tune the hyper parameters to eek out the last bit of optimization. 

This is not reality. 

In the real world perfection is not the goal. 

Rather it’s improvement and iteration. 

The best data scientists develop tools that are better than the current system, iteratively improve, and track progress. Their goal is innovation and speed. 

Beat the current system, and your organization will love you for it. Do it many times and your career will take off."
