# Phase 01: Business Understanding

### Primary Objective(s) in this Phase, and in any Business-Driven DS Project: 

**Use Exploratory techniques with the goal of:**

* Sizing the business problem and see if it's worth our time.

Matt says that *sizing the business opportunity or cost is OVERLOOKED by most data scientist. If the cost/benefit to the organization is not large, it's not worth my time (or the organizations time).*

**We need to be efficient, which is our second focus.**

## ROI is First, Efficiency is Second

**In Phase 1: Business Understanding,** we take what we've learned about the employee attrition business problem and apply the core BSPF steps in stages 1 through 4 as we analyze the problem. This chapter is critical because of its emphasis on problem solving and how you can use R programming to show the organization what's going on under the hood. In this chapter, you will learn how to:

* Tackle a business problem with R
* Create a simplified code workflow using Tidy Eval
* Make an impactful plot with ggplot2
* Build a custom plotting function using ggplot2 and Tidy Eval

## High-Level Workflow for Business Understanding

1. View Business as a Machine
2. Understand the Drivers
3. Measure the Drivers
4. Uncover Problems & Opportunities (show business areas have the highest cost)

### Key Terminology for discussing Outcomes with Business
**Cohort:** Group within a population that often has specific sub-population trends.
**Sub-Categories:** Identifying sub-categories w/in cohorts can even further help in defining relationships.
**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** Getting data and engineering features relevant to business.


### How to Move through and develop Business Understanding (e.g., Understanding the Business Problem)

Always approach the problem by acquiring the simplest dataset first. Import it and get it in the tidy format.
We will learn something and then circle back to get more data if the problem is worth further investigation.

## Workflow

1. Read in and subset a few features that look interesting and productive.
