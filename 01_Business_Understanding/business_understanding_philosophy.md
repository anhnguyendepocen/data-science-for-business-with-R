## Chapter 1: Business Understanding

**In Chapter 1: Business Understanding,** we take what we've learned about the employee attrition business problem and apply the core BSPF steps in stages 1 through 4 as we analyze the problem. This chapter is critical because of its emphasis on problem solving and how you can use R programming to show the organization what's going on under the hood. In this chapter, you will learn how to:

* Tackle a business problem with R
* reate a simplified code workflow using Tidy Eval
* Make an impactful plot with ggplot2
* Build a custom plotting function using ggplot2 and Tidy Eval
