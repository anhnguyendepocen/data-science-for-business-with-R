## Chapter 1: Business Understanding

**In Chapter 1: Business Understanding,** we take what we've learned about the employee attrition business problem and apply the core BSPF steps in stages 1 through 4 as we analyze the problem. This chapter is critical because of its emphasis on problem solving and how you can use R programming to show the organization what's going on under the hood. In this chapter, you will learn how to:

* Tackle a business problem with R
* Create a simplified code workflow using Tidy Eval
* Make an impactful plot with ggplot2
* Build a custom plotting function using ggplot2 and Tidy Eval

## High-Level Workflow for Business Understanding

1. View Business as a Machine
2. Understand the Drivers
3. Measure the Drivers
4. Uncover Problems & Opportunities (show business areas have the highest cost)

### Key Terminology for discussing Outcomes with Business
**Cohort:** Group within a population that often has specific sub-population trends.
**Sub-Categories:** Identifying sub-categories w/in cohorts can even further help in defining relationships.
**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** Getting data and engineering features relevant to business.


### How to Move through and develop Business Understanding (e.g., Understanding the Business Problem)

Always approach the problem by acquiring the simplest dataset first. Import it and get it in the tidy format.
We will learn something and then circle back to get more data if the problem is worth further investigation.

## Workflow

1. Read in and subset a few features that look interesting and productive.
